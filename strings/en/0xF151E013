A script error has been logged to the mc_lastexception.html file located in the same folder as the MCCC mod files.  This error almost always happens as a result of bad or out-of-date mods or CC.  It will continue to happen until the mods or cc are removed or updated.  For support, the mc_lastexception.html file can be uploaded to our Discord server.  Thanks!
