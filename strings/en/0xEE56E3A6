If enabled, the first time a LE happens in the current zone, a notification will be shown.  No other notifications will be shown until the player changes to another zone or does something else to trigger the current lot to reload.   If disabled, a notification will be shown every time an exception occurs.  Note that mc_cmd_center.log errors will still show for each error that occurs
